# üöó Smart City Traffic Analysis System

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive traffic analysis solution for smart city initiatives. It analyzes traffic patterns across multiple junctions, identifies peak traffic periods, and provides actionable recommendations for infrastructure planning and traffic management.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- **Traffic Pattern Analysis**: Understand traffic patterns across different time periods and junctions
- **Peak Traffic Identification**: Identify peak traffic hours and periods for better resource allocation
- **Holiday Pattern Analysis**: Analyze how traffic patterns change during holidays and special occasions
- **Forecasting**: Predict future traffic patterns for proactive planning
- **Infrastructure Recommendations**: Provide data-driven recommendations for smart city infrastructure

## üìä Dataset Information

The analysis uses two datasets:
- **Training Data**: Historical traffic data with vehicle counts, timestamps, and junction information
- **Test Data**: Future timestamps for which traffic predictions are needed

### Data Structure
- `DateTime`: Timestamp of the traffic measurement
- `Junction`: Traffic junction identifier (1-4)
- `Vehicles`: Number of vehicles counted
- `ID`: Unique identifier for each record

## üöÄ Features

### 1. Comprehensive Data Exploration
- Data quality assessment
- Missing value analysis
- Statistical summaries
- Time range analysis

### 2. Traffic Pattern Analysis
- **Hourly Patterns**: Identify peak traffic hours
- **Daily Patterns**: Compare weekday vs weekend traffic
- **Weekly Patterns**: Analyze weekly traffic trends
- **Monthly Patterns**: Seasonal traffic variations
- **Junction Comparison**: Compare traffic across different junctions

### 3. Holiday and Special Occasion Analysis
- Holiday traffic pattern identification
- Special event impact analysis
- Weekend vs weekday comparisons

### 4. Advanced Forecasting
- Machine learning-based traffic prediction
- Feature importance analysis
- Model performance evaluation
- Time series forecasting capabilities

### 5. Smart City Recommendations
- Infrastructure planning recommendations
- Traffic management strategies
- Operational recommendations
- Long-term strategic planning

## üìà Generated Visualizations

The system generates several key visualizations:

1. **Hourly Traffic Patterns**: Shows average traffic by hour of day
2. **Daily Traffic Patterns**: Compares traffic across days of the week
3. **Weekly Traffic Trends**: Shows traffic patterns over weeks
4. **Monthly Traffic Analysis**: Seasonal variations in traffic
5. **Junction Comparison**: Traffic patterns across different junctions
6. **Weekend vs Weekday**: Comparison of weekend and weekday traffic
7. **Seasonal Patterns**: Traffic patterns by season
8. **Holiday Patterns**: Traffic during holidays vs regular days
9. **Prediction Accuracy**: Model performance visualization

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download the project files**

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure your data files are in the data folder**:
   - `data/train_aWnotuB.csv` (training dataset)
   - `data/datasets_8494_11879_test_BdBKkAj.csv` (test dataset)

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

### Quick Start (Recommended)

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Quick Analysis (Fast):**
   ```bash
   python quick_analysis.py
   ```
   This gives you immediate insights without generating visualizations.

3. **Run Complete Analysis (Full):**
   ```bash
   python traffic_analysis.py
   ```
   This runs the full analysis with visualizations (takes longer).

### Alternative Usage

**Run Examples:**
```bash
python example_usage.py
```

**Use in Jupyter Notebook:**
```python
from traffic_analysis import TrafficAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = TrafficAnalyzer('train_aWnotuB.csv', 'datasets_8494_11879_test_BdBKkAj.csv')

# Run complete analysis
analyzer.run_complete_analysis()
```

### What Each File Does:

- **`quick_analysis.py`** ‚Üí Fast insights without plots
- **`traffic_analysis.py`** ‚Üí Complete analysis with visualizations
- **`example_usage.py`** ‚Üí Usage examples and demonstrations
- **`Intern.ipynb`** ‚Üí Your learning notebook (optional)
- **`README.md`** ‚Üí This documentation file
